<title>aVo archive</title>
<h1>Welcome to the aVo archive.</h1>
<p>This is where I attempt to archive every aVo video, with original audio (if I can find it)</p>
<br>
<p>Every archived aVo video page on this site will be also saved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, in case anything here has to be taken down for copyright reasons, or any other problems.</p>

<p>this is not finished yet im currently just archiving tnt for my friend to watch. it'll eventually be in chronological order.</p>
